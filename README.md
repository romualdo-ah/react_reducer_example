This project was created for studying porpuses.

File DataFetching.js was created and used a reducer function and a component named <a href="">DataFetching.js</a>. 
the component uses an external API to make POST, GET, and DELETE requests.

## Launch here to test:
<a href="https://romualdo-ah.github.io/react_reducer_example">https://romualdo-ah.github.io/react_reducer_example</a>

## The API used

## The goal

The goal of this project is to show an alternative to clean up the DataFetching component by separating the state handling on a external function (reducer), and share some global states between other components.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
