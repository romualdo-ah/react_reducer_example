# React_reducer_example

Launch here to test:

This project was created for studying porpuses.
On the component DataFetching was created and used a reducer function. 
On the project is used an external API to make POST, GET, and DELETE request.
This API you can be founded at <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/" target="_blank">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com</a> 

## The goal

The goal is to clean up the DataFetching component by separating the state handling on a external function (reducer), and share some global states between other components.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
