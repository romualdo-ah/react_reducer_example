This project was created for studying porpuses.

## Launch here to test:
<a href="https://romualdo-ah.github.io/react_reducer_example">https://romualdo-ah.github.io/react_reducer_example</a>


File DataFetching.js was created and used a reducer function and a component named <a href="https://github.com/romualdo-ah/react_reducer_example/blob/master/src/components/DataFetching.js">DataFetching.js</a>. 
This component uses an external API to make POST, GET, and DELETE requests.

## The API used

<a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/" target="_blank">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com</a> 

## The goal

The goal of this project is to show an alternative to clean up the DataFetching component by separating the state handling on a external function (reducer), and share some global states between other components.
